      * This module helps track detailed health insurance policies for employees and their dependents, with dynamic computation of policy amounts based on:
         - Insurance Grades
         - Insurance Contracts
      * A table is added to the employee profile to utilize, among other things, the following:
          _ Name
          _ Relation
          _ Birthdate
          _ Grade
          _ Employee Contribution percentage (to deduct from policy amount on payroll)
          _ Manual Contribution ( to manage cases with manual fixed amounts that override the current contract amounts on the set insurance contract)
      * Payroll Integration –  A salary rule is added on salary structure creation to automatically deduct the applicable monthly amount when generating employee payslips.
