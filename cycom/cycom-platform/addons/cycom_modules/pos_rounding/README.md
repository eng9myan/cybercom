# POS Collect Later Module

## Overview

This module allows POS orders to be marked as "Collect Later" when customers pay in full but don't collect their orders immediately. The module maintains full accounting compliance (invoices remain paid) while providing operational tracking for uncollected orders.

## Features

1. **POS Option – "Collect Later"**
   - Add a checkbox in POS payment screen: "Collect Later"
   - When selected, a mandatory popup appears before payment completion:
     - Expected collection date (required)
     - Notes / remarks (optional)
   - Payment cannot be completed unless these details are provided

2. **Invoice Handling**
   - Invoice is created and fully paid as usual (no impact on accounting)
   - A new field "Collect Later" is added to the invoice for audit and reporting
   - Invoice remains in Paid state

3. **Operational Tracking Model**
   - Dedicated model `pos.collect.later.tracking` to track Paid but Uncollected POS Orders
   - Each record includes:
     - POS Order
     - Invoice
     - Customer
     - Paid amount
     - Expected collection date
     - Status flow: Pending Collection → Collected / Cancelled

4. **Employee View – Pending Collection Screen**
   - Dedicated menu item: "Pending Collection Orders"
   - View all paid but uncollected orders
   - Search by customer, order number, or date
   - Filter by status, date, overdue orders
   - Group by status, customer, or date

5. **Collection Process (When Customer Returns)**
   - Employee opens the original POS order
   - A button "Mark as Collected" is available
   - System automatically:
     - Removes/unchecks the "Collect Later" flag
     - Updates the tracking record status to Collected
   - No new invoices or payments are created
